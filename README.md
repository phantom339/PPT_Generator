# PPT_Generator

Thrilled to share my latest project: an AI-powered Presentation Generator! 🚀

From a blank slide to a full presentation in under a minute? This tool makes it possible, designed to save you hours of work. ⏱️

It streamlines the entire creation process. Just provide a topic, and the AI takes over.

Under the hood, it's a powerful stack:

🧠 The Brain: I'm using Google's powerful Gemma-3-27b-it LLM to craft relevant and engaging text for each slide.

👁️ The Eye for Design: The agent generates a unique 5-word string to pull high-quality, copyright-free images from the Pexels API, ensuring your slides are visually stunning.

🧩 The Builder: The magic comes together with the python-pptx library, which assembles the content and images into a professional .pptx file, ready for you to download.

💻 The Interface: A minimalist and user-friendly UI built with Streamlit makes the tool accessible to everyone.

I've attached a video to show you just how fast and efficient it is. 👇 I'd love to hear your feedback in the comments!
